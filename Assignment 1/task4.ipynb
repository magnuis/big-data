The problem: mining the interests of experts\n","\n","The primary role of a questions and answering platform such as Stack Exchange is to connect two types of people. Namely, people who have questions in areas such as computer science or data science and knowledgeable people who can answer those questions reliably. Let's call the first category of people' knowledge seekers' and the second one 'expert users' or 'experts' for short.\n","\n","Here we want to answer a question related to the diversity of topics that experts are interested in using our data. We want to know if expert users only answer questions in a specific set of topics or their interests include a wide variety of topics.\n","\n","To answer the above question, we will compute the correlation between a user's expertise level and the diversity of topics of questions they have answered. The first step is to define two variables (or measures); first for 'user expertise level' and then for 'user interest diversity'. Then we will use the Pearson correlation coefficient to measure the linear correlation between the two variables. We define the variables as:\n","\n","   - VariableA (the measure of user expertise level). We will use the 'Reputation' column from 'users' table, which according to Stack Exchange's documentation \"is a rough measurement of how much the community trusts you; it is earned by convincing your peers that you know what you're talking about\" as an indicator of a user's expertise level on the platform. \n","\n","   - VariableB (The measure of user interest diversity). We measure the diversity of a user's interests by computing the total number of distinct tags associated with the questions each user has answered divided by the total number of unique tags which is 638.\n","\n","Compute the Pearson correlation coefficient between VariableA and VariableB, and based on the result you've got, answer the following question: \n","\n","     Do expert users have specif interests or do they have general interests?\n","\n","Please explain your reasoning on how you reached your answer.\n","\n","You should use Apache Spark API for your implementation.
